# About Me
## Hobbies
- My hobbies include resin art, reading, coloring, organizing, filming videos on Tik Tok, creating suncatchers, woodworking, diamond art, and a multitude of other activities!
## Websites I Recommend
- [Google](www.google.com) Google is my go to for eveything and anything. When I have a question about something or need a reminder of basic geography, google search bar is where I go. It really feels like my personal virtual assistant. Haha!
- [TikTok](www.tiktok.com) This is my very website for both entertainment and learning. I can get a good laugh or have some sort of life breakthrough watching and engaging with other creators. I'm glad this app is here to stay!
